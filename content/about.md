I graduated *magna cum laude* from the University of Notre Dame in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics. Some of the high-level courses I took there were:

- Compilers and Language Design,
- Programming Languages,
- Theory of Computing,
- Theory of Numbers,
- Algebraic Geometry, and
- Basic Combinatorics.

My interests lie in:

- theoretical computer science,
- applied mathematics, and
- hands-on medicine.
